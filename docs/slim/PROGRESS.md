# PROGRESS — SLIM-FIX (R368), the durable resume point

Resume from THIS file after any stop, never from memory. Updated at every leg exit.

## Where the run is

- Branch: `claude/slim-fix-r368`, cut from `origin/claude/slim-scout-census-v3i2hj` @ 1e8d6d6 (base dev 69e1532).
- Host: the operator's desktop (not a Claude environment; `CLAUDE_CODE_ENVIRONMENT_NAME` unset). AMD Ryzen 7
  3700X, 16 threads, 46 GiB, flags `avx2` only (no `avx512_bf16`, no `amx`). torch 2.11.0+cpu, `mantis._engine` OK.
- origin/dev = 69e1532 at W0 entry (no moved commits; no rebase).
- Wave: **W0** (entry). Leg: W0. Last commit: see `git log`. Next step: the BEFORE sweep's walls, the re-probe
  results, then W1.

## W0 — entry

| step | state |
|---|---|
| env name printed | unset (operator's desktop) |
| `uv sync` + `import torch, mantis._engine` | GREEN |
| git fetch / origin/dev | 69e1532, nothing to rebase |
| host record | above |
| BEFORE sweep (`make gates.exit`, own worktree at 1e8d6d6, own venv) | RUNNING |
| R368 landed | 9ee503d7 |
| test_count_floor 4862 → 5112 (collected at base) | 1fbddf17 |
| re-probe of the 30 PENDING-PROBE rows | RUNNING |

## W1 — correctness (01_DEFECTS 1–39, 42)

Rows a later wave resolves, named here per the packet:
- 15 (TrainerLike.train_step_from_tensors phantom) → W3, AQ-PHANTOM by R368(d).
- 16 (InferenceServer.submit_and_wait reshapes to a None shape) → W3 with CORE-2-03 (the grid arm); fixed there
  if the method survives.
- 17 (corpus_metrics creates reports/ at import) → W3, CORE-2-01 deletes the module.
- 23 (comment_lint misses bare R-cites and docstrings) → W4, where gate 14 learns both classes.
- 24 (test_count_floor 4862 vs 5112) → DONE in W0 (1fbddf17).
